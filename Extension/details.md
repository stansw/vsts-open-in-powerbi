### Open an entire query in Excel for editing, data analysis and more
To access an entire query, navigate to Work > Queries, select the query you would like to open and use the right-click option in the context menu to "Open in Excel". You can also click the "Open in Excel" button available on the Queries toolbar as well.

### Select multiple work items and open them in Excel
Sometimes you may want to select a specific set of work items from a query, not the entire query. To do this, select the work items you want (hold Shift to select multiple consecutive work items or Ctrl to select multiple work items) and use the Right-click on selected work items to "Open in Excel."
